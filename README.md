# Behavioral-Analysis-To-Control-Cyber-Crimes-And-Fraud-Detection

The purpose of the project is to detect the Behavioural Analysis in order to Control Cyber 
Crimes and subsequent Fraud Detection. The data here is trained using neural networks 
about the particular pattern using credit card. Based on the pattern of transaction 
using the credit card, neural networks make use of predicting algorithms to classify 
whether the transaction is fraud or not (0 or 1).
